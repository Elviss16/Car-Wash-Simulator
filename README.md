This Project Simulates a Car Wash System:

Cars arrive randomly based on an arrival probability.
They queue up if the washer is busy.
The washer processes cars one at a time, taking a fixed time per wash.
Simulation stops after 5 cars are served or when time runs out.

Tracks Customer Wait Times & Averages:

Records how long each car waited.
Calculates the average wait time.

Uses a Queue for Car Management:

Cars are stored in a queue (FIFO order).
Cars are dequeued when they enter the wash.
